# speaker-diarization

This repository contains the Cog definition files for the associated speaker diarization model [deployed on Replicate](https://replicate.com/meronym/speaker-diarization).

This model receives an audio file and identifies the individual speakers within the recording. The output is a list of annotated speech segments, along with global information about the number of detected speakers and an embedding vector for each speaker to describe the quality of his/her voice.

## Model description

The model is based on a pre-trained speaker diarization pipeline from the [`pyannote.audio`](pyannote.github.io) package, with a post-processing layer that cleans up the output segments and computes input-wide speaker embeddings.

`pyannote.audio` is an open-source toolkit written in Python for speaker diarization based on [PyTorch](pytorch.org). It provides a set of trainable end-to-end neural building blocks that can be combined and jointly optimized to build speaker diarization pipelines.

The main pipeline makes use of:

- `pyannote/segmentation` for permutation-invariant speaker segmentation on temporal slices
- `speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb` for generating speaker embeddings
- `AgglomerativeClustering` for matching embeddings across temporal slices

See [this post](https://herve.niderb.fr/fastpages/2022/10/23/One-speaker-segmentation-model-to-rule-them-all.html) (written by the `pyannote.audio` author) for more details.

## Input format

Starting from version `64b78c82`, the model now uses `ffmpeg` to decode the input audio, so it supports a wide variety of input formats - including, but not limited to `mp3`, `aac`, `flac`, `ogg`, `opus`, `wav`.

## Output format

The model outputs a single `output.json` file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "segments": [
    {
      "speaker": "A",
      "start": "0:00:00.497812",
      "stop": "0:00:09.779063"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "B",
      "start": "0:00:09.863438",
      "stop": "0:03:34.962188"
    }
  ],
  "speakers": {
    "count": 2,
    "labels": [
      "A",
      "B"
    ],
    "embeddings": {
      "A": [<array of 192 floats>],
      "B": [<array of 192 floats>]
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance

The current T4 deployment has an average processing speed factor of 12x (relative to the length of the audio input) - e.g. it will take the model approx. 1 minute of computation to process 12 minutes of audio.

## Intended use

Data augmentation and segmentation for a variety of transcription and captioning tasks (e.g. interviews, podcasts, meeting recordings, etc.). Speaker recognition can be implemented by matching the speaker embeddings against a database of known speakers.

## Ethical considerations

This model may have biases based on the data it has been trained on. It is important to use the model in a responsible manner and adhere to ethical and legal standards.
